# squash_game_implementation

### Functionality

This the squash game using Python and Pygame libarary created in the OOP approach. This code was based on the Computerphile Pygame tutorial and is my own implementation of the problem.
The basic aim of the squash game is to keep bouncing the ball of the controlable paddle for as long as you can.

### File structure
The Squash_game consist the following files:
- squash.py _consist of the main classes (Paddle & Ball) and runs a fully functional Squash game _
- requirements.txt _contains the required packages for the project._


The test files are still under development and will be included in the main project catalog.
