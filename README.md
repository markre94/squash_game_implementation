# squash_game_implementation

### Functionality

This the squash game using Python and Pygame libarary created in the OOP approach. This code was based on the Computerphile Pygame tutorial and is my own implementation of the problem.
The basic aim of the squash game is to keep bouncing the ball of the controlable paddle for as long as you can.

### File structure
The Squash_game consist the following files:
- squash.py _consist of the main classes (Paddle & Ball) and runs a fully functional Squash game _
- requirements.txt _contains the required packages for the project._


The test files are still under development and will be included in the main project catalog.

### Linear Regression

For the purpose of creating a model suitable enough to predict the position of the Paddle the KNN algorithm was used.
To colect enough data that could be used in KNN algorithm the model first was trained by user playing a game for some time and writing all the needed posistions to a "game1.csv" file.

### Additional challenges

- [ ] write tests for the completed game and placed the test file in the main catalog
- [x] add second paddle to transform the squash game into a pong game for 2 players
- [x] add data science to enable playing against AI
- [ ] add more doc strings to make code more user friendly
